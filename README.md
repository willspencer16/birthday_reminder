# Birthday Reminder

A simple React project I did to cement my knowledge of the useState hook, whilst furthering my knowledge of React, following a tutorial by ```freeCodeCamp.org```.

The app uses an array of hardcoded data, from the data.js filem, to populate a list component, using the useState hook, to display the data:

Similarly, this can be cleared using a button component, which uses the useState hook function to update the value to an empty array:

Thus clearing the list.

## To Use

- Git clone the repository to your local machine.
- Run `yarn install` in your terminal to install dependencies.
- Once installation is complete, run `yarn start` in your terminal.

This should start the app in browser. Enjoy!
